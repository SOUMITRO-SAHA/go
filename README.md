## Getting Started

To follow along with my journey and experiment with Go yourself, make sure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download and install Go from the [official website](https://golang.org/dl/). Once installed, set up your workspace as per the instructions in the Go documentation.

## Basics of Go

In this section, I'll cover the fundamentals of the Go programming language. We'll start with basic syntax, data types, control structures, and functions. I'll document my learning process, code snippets, and any challenges I encounter.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

As I progress, I'll dive into data structures and algorithms using Go. I'll explore common data structures such as arrays, slices, maps, and structs, and implement various algorithms to solve problems efficiently. Expect to see code examples, explanations, and analysis of time and space complexity.

## REST API Development

One of my goals is to become proficient in developing RESTful APIs using Go. In this section, I'll document my journey of building APIs, handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware, authentication, and more. I'll share code snippets, best practices, and lessons learned along the way.

## Setting Up Servers

Understanding server setup and configuration is essential for deploying Go applications. I'll explore different server setups, including traditional HTTP servers, microservices architecture, and deployment using containers. Expect to find documentation, tutorials, and configuration files.

## MongoDB Connections

As part of building robust applications, I'll learn how to connect and interact with MongoDB databases using Go. I'll cover topics such as CRUD operations, querying data, indexing, and working with MongoDB in a concurrent environment.

## Resources

Throughout my journey, I'll rely on various resources to enhance my understanding of Go and related technologies. In this section, I'll compile a list of helpful books, articles, tutorials, and online courses that I find valuable.
