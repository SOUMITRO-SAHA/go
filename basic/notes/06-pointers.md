# Pointers

Pointers in `Go` programming language or Golang is a variable that is used to store the memory address of another variable. The variables are used to store some data at a particular memory address in the system. The memory address is always found in hexadecimal format(starting with 0x like 0xFFAAF etc.).

- The & operator is used to get the memory address of a variable.
- The \* operator is used to declare a pointer and to dereference it (get the value stored at the memory address).
